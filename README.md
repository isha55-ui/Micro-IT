  • Resembles a physical calculator with rounded corners and shadows<br>
  • Responsive design that works on mobile devices<br><br>

  <strong>Functionality:</strong><br>

  • Digits 0-9 with proper number input handling<br>
  • Additional features: decimal point, clear, percentage, sign toggle<br>
  • Real-time display showing both current input and operation history<br>
  • Keyboard support for all operations
  
  <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong><br>
  • Clean, object-oriented JavaScript with a Calculator class<br>
  • Event listeners for both click and keyboard interactions<br>
  • Robust error handling (division by zero, number formatting)<br>
  • State management for complex calculations<br>
  • Comments explaining all major functions and logic<br><br>

  <strong>User Experience:</strong><br>

  The calculator handles edge cases like division by zero, supports keyboard input, and maintains state properly for chained calculations. The code is well-structured and commented for easy maintenance and modification.
